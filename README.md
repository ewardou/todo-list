The todo-list project I created lets the user create different list of tasks that contain information like the description, title, deadline, etc. The list and tasks can be created, deleted and edited. The UI is simple and contains buttons that display a modal when clicked, where the user can input the required information to create new elements. This project was the first time I used the localStorage element and Json, to allow the user to keep the information saved for a later session. While doing this, I was also able to continue practicing the use of webpack and the ES6 modules, and I tried to apply the single responsibility principle whenever possible to try to write more organized code.
